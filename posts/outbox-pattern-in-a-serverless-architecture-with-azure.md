## Introduction

Distributed systems provide many benefits by distributing processing and storage across multiple nodes, including:

- 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲
- 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
- 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆
However, these benefits rely on certain assumptions, such as:

- 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸
- 𝗭𝗲𝗿𝗼 𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆
- 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗯𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘄𝗶𝗱𝘁𝗵
- 𝗛𝗼𝗺𝗼𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗼𝘂𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸
- 
As we all know, 𝗠𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗵𝘆’𝘀 𝗟𝗮𝘄 states that things can go wrong quickly. Losing a message between two services can be a critical issue.

To address these challenges, distributed systems often use techniques such as distributed transactions, consensus protocols, or the Outbox Pattern to maintain data consistency. These techniques can help to ensure that all nodes in the system see a consistent view of the data, even in the face of network latency, concurrency, partitioning, and failures.

Here’s we will focus on the outbox pattern in modern serverless architecture with Azure.
